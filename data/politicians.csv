ocd-division/country:us/state:ca,Governor,Edmund G. Brown Jr.,A,"Recently Governor Brown has been much more helpful on housing. He has been using his prower and influence to promote permit streamlining bills. Permit streamlining is important for getting housing built because it reduces the ability of small numbers of immediate neighbors to interfere with new housing. Governor Brown put our bills - AB 678 & SB 167 on his list of must pass bills this legislaive session, which is helping them tremendously.  ",

The Mortgage Interest Deduction is a subsidy for the kind of person who has a mortgage of $500,000 or greater, aka someone in the top 8% of incomes in the US. HR 948 is progressive tax reform that would increse taxes on high income earners & spend the money to house the homeless. It was introduced by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. 

Please feel free to contact Pelosi & ask her to throw her weight behond HR 948. ",
